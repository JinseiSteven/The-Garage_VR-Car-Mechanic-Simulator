## Description
The aim of our project was to develop a VR-Experience in which players would learn basic tasks concerning car-maintenance. During the game, players would be able to learn tasks like changing a tire, refilling coolant, etc in an accessible and interactive manner. By using Virtual Reality, this could create a safe and realistic environment in which the player could practice these skills while not being afraid to make expensive or dangerous mistakes.

The setting of the game is a simple and cozy home garage, where the user has many car maintenance items at their disposal, which they could realistically have at home. Furthermore, during the game the player will be guided by a narrator, telling them what to do and how to do it safely. Overall, The Garage provides an engaging and educational VR experience that allows players to build confidence in essential car maintenance skills, all within a safe and immersive environment.
